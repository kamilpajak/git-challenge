# Git Challenge
*Reference user acceptance tests*

This project is designed to serve as my reference user acceptance tests. I hope you'll find it useful!

## Prerequisites

Before running tests you need to create an `application.properties` file and set your GitHub credentials:

```

```

## Running the tests

To run the tests just execute `mvn clean test`
